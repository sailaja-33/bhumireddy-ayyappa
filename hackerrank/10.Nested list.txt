10.Given the names and grades for each student in a class of N students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.

Note: If there are multiple students with the second lowest grade, order their names alphabetically and print each name on a new line.

Example

records=[["chi",20.0],["beta",50.0],["alpha",50.0]] The ordered list of scores is [20.0,50.0], so the second lowest score is 50.0. There are two students with that score:["beta","alpha"]. Ordered alphabetically, the names are printed as:

alpha
beta

code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    score_lst = []
    marksheet =[]
    
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        name = input()
        score = float(input())
        score_lst.append(score)
        marksheet.append([name,score])
    second_low = sorted(list(set(score_lst)))[1]
    names = [ name for name,scores in sorted(marksheet) if scores == second_low]
    print('\n'.join(names))

code:
5
Harry
37.21
Berry
37.21
Tina
37.2
Akriti
41
Harsh
39

output:
Berry
Harry
